# Django-Inktober

This web app was made to teach me django. With django I was able to make a website for Inktober. This Inktober website uses pictures created by Jake Parker, the creator of Inktober. Inktober is a challenge for people to get out of their comfort zone and draw art. 

The purpose of this software was to teach me new skills. I wanted to cover more things and learn new skils that can be applicable to other projects. I had a ton of fun with this project and was glad I learned something new in the process.

# Webpages
* HOME PAGE - The home page talks about the overall idea of the website. This also describes what Inktober is and has some pictures drawn for it along with a video to describe Inktober. This page is dynamic due to the embed video on the front page.

* FAQ PAGE - The FAQ page describes what the word is. The most frequently asked questions are in this page and allow the user to resolve any questions they might have.

* USER PAGE - The user page allows the user to type in their information and submit it. This page askes for the first name, last name, email, and prompt idea. This prompt idea relates to Inktober. The dynamics int he page is the acceptance of the users information. 

* RESPONSE PAGE - The response page is a page to thank the user for their submission. This will also have a final picture to motivate the user to participate in Inktober. This page is dynamic since it can only be reached through the user page submission.
